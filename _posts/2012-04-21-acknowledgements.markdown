The following art and other assets are included by Roll20 for personal, non-commercial use inside of your campaigns.

**Tokens by Devin Night**

A great set of tokens that cover many of the most-used types of monsters and PC classes in fantasy roleplaying games. Devin also has additional tokens for sale on [his website](http://immortalnights.com), which you can drag and drop to upload to Roll20 and use in your campaigns after purchase.

**Fantastic Maps Dungeon Tileset by Jonathan Roberts**

This is a great tileset that features everything from walls to floors and even details like hanging lamps and candles. You'll find it by searching inside the Art library for keywords such as "wall" or "candle". Find more of Jonathan's great work at [his website](http://fantasticmaps.wordpress.com).

**Web Search**

Roll20 features a powerful web search that automatically searches the web for art assets from many different online sources. Credit is given above the image in the results view for each of the assets. We do our best to only find assets that are released for free personal use, but if you find an asset that's been included by our search engine by mistake, please [let us know](mailto:team@roll20.net).

**Music**

Roll20's Jukebox feature lets you find music to use during your play sessions. It searches the [SoundCloud](http://www.soundcloud.com) website, which features music produced and shared by a variety of independent artists.


Open Source Software
--------------------


Roll20 couldn't exist without standing on the shoulders of giants. The following open-source projects have helped make it a reality.

* [RaphaelJS](http://raphaeljs.com) -- a fantastic SVG art library, it's the graphics engine that helps us show your worlds.
* [OpenTok](http://tokbox.com) -- lets us bring you video and voice chat
* [Firebase](http://firebase.com) -- the service that helps us keep everyone in sync in real-time, with automatic conflict resolution.
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com) -- needs no introduction, a seminal piece of Javascript
* [BackboneJS](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone) -- keeps us organized when everything is flying around in a giant mess
* [Padrino](http://padrinorb.com) -- powers the administration section of the site
* [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) -- the amazing concurrent server that lets us keep the info flowing
* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) -- gives us the style we need to look somewhat legitimate

Please note that this is not an exhaustive list, but we wanted to especially recognize these projects that make us tick. Open source powers the web, and we thank all of the programmers who take time out of their busy schedule to make the world a better place.
