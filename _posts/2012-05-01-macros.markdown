__Macros__ are user-defined shortcuts to functions you regularly want to repeat.  Go to the Settings tab (housed under the small gear image) at the top right of the Roll20 interface.  To enter a macro, first type what you want to call the command.  Example: "*test*".  Then to the right, put in the command.  This could be typed text, a roll, or emote.  Press "Enter" after this information to save the command.  

  To use the macro, type _#_ and the command (so *#test*) and press enter.  There is also a tab auto-complete function for macros.
  
Multiple commands
--------
One of the strengths of the macro system is it's ability to execute multiple actions with a single command. To do this, simply put each item on it's own line, and they will be executed in order when you run the macro.

###Example

If I want to create a macro that will include an emote, plus my attack and damage rolls it would look like this:

<code>#dagger</code>
<code>/me rams his dagger home</code><br>
<code>/roll 1d20+10  vs AC</code><br>
<code>/roll 1d4+9 Damage</code><br>

Then, simply by typing <code>#dagger</code> it would run the entire script and look like this: <img src="/images/AttackMacro.jpg" />

Macros can also include a mix of command and non-command lines, for example:

<code>#lof</code><br>
<code>/me calls upon the power of Moradin!</code><br>
<code>I smite you!</code><br>
<code>/roll 1d20+4 vs reflex</code><br>
<code>/roll 1d8+4 damage</code>

This would first emote, then send "<i>I smite you!</i>" to the chat, and then make the two rolls afterwards.


Nesting Macros
--------
Macros can be nested inside each other, which gives the ability to combine macros, and call multiple macros with a single action. To nest a macro, simply include the name of the macro you wish to call on its own line inside your macro.

###Example

In this example, we'll have three macros: <code>#damage</code> <code>#attack</code> and <code>#both</code>

Macro <code>#damage</code> = <code>/roll 1d4+11</code><br>
Macro <code>#attack</code> = <code>/roll 1d20+9</code><br>
Macro <code>#both</code> = <br>
<code>#attack</code><br>
<code>#damage</code>

Using a variable with a Macro
--------
  If you'd like to use a variable modifier with your macro roll, simply end the macro command with the modifier, and then specify it when calling your macro
  
###Example
  
  If I want a macro for 1d20+x (<i>where x is my variable value</i>) I could create the following macro:<br>
  <code>#d20/code> <code>/roll 1d20+</code><br>
  then, when running the macro, type <code>#d20</code><code>4</code> to get <code>/roll 1d20+4</code><br>
  
Macro Bar
--------

You can also create quick access buttons for any of your macros that will appear in a bar at the bottom of the screen. First, create your macro like normal. Then, to enable the macro quick bar, check off "Show macro quick bar" in the settings menu<br>

Then, to add a macro to the bar, simply check the "In bar" option next to the macro's name<br>

The quickbar, and any macros that you have selected should now appear on the bottom of your screen, underneath the character portraits. If you'd like to re-arrange the buttons on the bar, hover your mouse over the button that you'd like to move. A handle will appear on the right side of the button. You can drag the button around the bar by using this handle.
