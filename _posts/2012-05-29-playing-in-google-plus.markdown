By default, when you launch a campaign you will be playing on the Roll20 site itself, and using the built-in video and voice chat (powered by TokBox). However, you also have the option to take your game with you to a Google+ Hangout. 

To do so, just click on the name of the Campaign in your Campaigns listing to access the Campaign Details page. Then click the link labeled "Launch in Google+ Hangout".

This will open up a new Google+ Hangout in a new tab/window. Go through the normal process of creating a Hangout by indicating who should be invited to join the Hangout (note that anyone that you invite to the Hangout will have access to your Roll20 Campaign). The first time you launch a Roll20 Campaign in a Hangout you'll also need to give quick permission for Roll20 to access some limited information about you on Google+. Then the Hangout will load and your Roll20 Campaign will appear as well.

As your players join your Hangout, they'll need to click the "App" tab located under the "People" tab, and then choose to launch the Roll20 App. That's all there is to it!

Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

**Do I have to stick to either Google+ or Roll20 only for each campaign? Can I use a Campaign that we've already started to play in Google+?**

You can choose to launch any campaign in a Google+ Hangout, even one that you've already started and played inside Roll20. So you can play on Roll20 one session, then in Google+ the next, or any combination. In fact, for ease of use, we recommend doing all of your prep work on Roll20, and only launching the campaign in a Hangout when you're ready to play a session with your players. 

**Can some users play in Google+ and others play in the normal Roll20 interface?**

In theory, yes. However, players in Google+ will only see/hear (for video chat purposes) other Google+ players, and players on Roll20 will only see/hear other players using Roll20. So it's really not a recommended way or doing things, and not something we officially support.

**I'm getting an error saying that "Regretfully, it didn't work" because it doesn't know what campaign I want to play?**

You **must start the Google+ Hangout using the link on the Campaign Details screen inside Roll20.** If you create a new Hangout on Google+ and then just add the Roll20 app to the Hangout (for example, from your Recent Apps tab), then Roll20 won't know which Campaign you actually want to play and will show you this error message. Just go to Roll20 and use the "Launch in Google+ Hangout" link to create the Hangout and you won't receive this error.
