The Roll20 Turn Tracker exists to aid you and your players with turn-based games by presenting an interactive list to the group.  This feature is intentionally not automated, so that more game types are able to use it.

On the left hand side, click the small clock symbol to launch the Turn Tracker.

Notice that if you launch the turn tracker without a token that has been given a turn, you get the following message:

**ADDING TOKEN TURNS**

To give a token a turn, right click on the token-- the first option in the menu is “Add Turn”.  You can add multiple turns for the same token if desired.

If the token has a name that name WILL appear in the turn tracker, unless the token is not currently visible to players because it is on the GM layer.

Tokens on the GM layer that have been given a turn will not appear to your players in the Turn Tracker.  This is indicated in the Turn Tracker by the Token being greyed out.

**ADDING TOKEN VALUES**

There are several ways to add token values, all of which can be accomplished by both the GM and players.

You can simply click on the number next to the Token and type in a new number.

You can drag the result of a roll from the chat box to the Turn Tracker and drop it in the numerical field.

**ORDER OF TURNS**

You can manually drag tokens shown in the Roll20 Turn Tracker into any order you desire.

If you press the blue Turn Order Settings Button, you can reorder and sort the current list either numerically or alphabetically.

**ROTATING TURNS**

To rotate turns in the tracker, simply press the arrow button, and the 2nd item will become first and so on.

**RESETTING THE TURN TRACKER**

If you press the blue Turn Order Setting Button, click the red “Remove All Turns” (Clear List) button to completely reset the Turn Tracker.
