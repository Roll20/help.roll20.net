##English, not Legalese

Most Terms of Service and Privacy Policy documents are unreadable. They are written by lawyers and for lawyers, and in our opinion are not very effective.

Because we believe in establishing long-term relationships with our customers, we decided to use plain English instead, to make our terms as clear as possible.

Please don’t forget that we are real people: take a look at our about page to get to know us a little. We are not perfect, but we’re trying our hardest, because we genuinely care about your success.

When you read Tailor Made or we below, it refers to Tailor Made Solutions, LLC, its affiliates, and agents.

Should you have other questions or concerns about this document, please send us an e-mail at [team@roll20.net](mailto:team@roll20.net).

##Using Roll20 means accepting these terms

By accessing or using Roll20 in any way, whether you have created your own Roll20 account or are invited to view someone’s private content on Roll20 (such as joining a game as a player), or are just browsing around, you agree to and are bound by the terms and conditions written in this document.

If you do not agree to all of the terms and conditions contained in this document, do not access Roll20.

##This is a living document

This is a living document. With your help, we want to make it the best in the industry.

If you read something that rubs you the wrong way, or if you think of something that should be added, please get in touch! We’re all ears! Email [team@roll20.net](mailto:team@roll20.net) and we’ll chat.

We don’t amend this document for any particular customer, but if your changes apply to all of our customers, we’ll be happy to update it for everyone. Scroll to the bottom to see the history so far.

We will likely improve this document over time. By continuing to use the site, you will implicitely accept the changes we make.

Your access and use of Roll20 is always subject to the most current version of this document.

##Breach of Terms

If you breach any of the terms and conditions in this document, your authorization to access or use Roll20 automatically terminates. Any materials downloaded or printed from Roll20 in violation of the Terms of Use must be immediately destroyed.

We may block, restrict, disable, suspend or terminate your access to all or part of Roll20 at any time in our sole discretion, without prior notice or liability to you. To this day, we have never had to do this, and we hope it never happens.

If you think we removed your access by mistake, let us know and we’ll give you our reasoning. We also have a quick way to restore access without losing any of your data.

#Support

Support for Roll20 is provided via our [Community Forums](http://community.roll20.net). We also provide a [Help and Documentation Site](http://help.roll20.net) with guides and screencasts that provide instruction on performing common tasks.

#Access to your data

##What personal data do you collect and why?

We collect the following personal data:

Name (including Display Name)
E-mail address
IP Address (for general statistics on usage and abuse prevention)

We do not collect Address or Credit Card information directly. See *Who can see my credit card number?* below.

We use return e-mail addresses to answer the e-mail we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.

Please be aware that your browser must be enabled to accept cookies from roll20.net in order for you to use Roll20.

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above.

##Who can see my password?

No-one. We never store your password unencrypted, so no-one can read it.

It is your sole responsibility to keep your email, password and other sensitive information confidential. If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security, you shall notify Tailor Made immediately.

If you forget your password, we send you a secure link via email that lets you reset it.

##Who can see my credit card number?

No-one at Tailor Made. We use the very trustworthy and secure [Stripe](http://stripe.com) payment service. Read about their security measures on the [Stripe Terms of Service](https://stripe.com/terms) (in short, they encrypt your credit card info using industry-standard practices).

##Our Commitment to Children’s Privacy

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.

##How can I access or correct my information?

You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by logging in to Roll20 and visiting the My Account page.

##Who can access my campaigns and other content?

By default, all campaigns and other assets that you create or upload to Roll20 are private. However, if you invite players to join your game, or choose to share your campaigns with other Roll20 users, then they will have access to view those specific campaigns and any assets used in those campaigns. Any assets that you upload to the Roll20 Marketplace will also be made public under the license that you select when the asset is submitted.

##What are the guidelines Tailor Made follows when accessing my data?

* We restrict who at Tailor Made can access customer data to only senior members of the team, and never to outside contractors.
* We only do it in response to a customer support question, or to look at issues affecting the entire Roll20 application.
* We only do it in order to debug and fix the issue.
* We never make changes to anything unless explicitly requested by a user.
* We never ever ever share what we see with other customers or the general public.
* We might give access to US authorities if requested in writing. We’ll try not to, but we don’t have the resources to fight the government. We’ll also keep the account owner informed as much as we can if this happens.

##How is my data protected from another customer’s data?

All of our customers’ data resides in the same database. We use software best practices to guarantee that only people who you designate as viewers of your data can access it. In other words, we segment our customer data via software. We do our best and are very confident we’re doing a good job at it, but, like every other web app that hosts their customers data on the same database, cannot guarantee that a sophisticated hacker cannot access other people’s data.

#Intellectual Property Rights

##Who owns Tailor Made materials?

Tailor Made materials are all the information, data, documents (e.g. white papers, press releases, datasheets, FAQs, etc.), communications, downloads, files, text, images, photographs, graphics, videos, webcasts, publications, content, tools, resources, software, code, programs and products on Roll20 produced by Tailor Made.

* The rights granted to you constitute a license and not a transfer of title.
* Any Tailor Made materials made available only upon payment of a fee may only be viewed, downloaded and printed subject to your payment of such fee.

##Who owns the IP of my campaigns and uploaded content?

Tailor Made does not claim intellectual property rights over campaigns or uploaded content on Roll20.

We leave it to each Roll20 user to decide who should own the IP of the materials created using their Roll20 account.

Content that you upload to the Roll20 Marketplace remains the IP of the original creator, and becomes subject to the additional terms found in the <a href="http://help.roll20.net/marketplace-eula/">Marketplace End User Licese Agreement (EULA)</a>.

You acknowledge and agree that Roll20 has no liability of any kind should anyone you granted access to your content modify, destroy, corrupt, copy or distribute it, or violate the terms of use or other limitations that you may impose on the use of your shared content.

Tailor Made does not pre-screen user materials that users provide or otherwise submit via Roll20; however, Tailor Made may remove any posted or submitted user materials from Roll20 for any reason without notice in its sole discretion. By posting or submitting your user materials, you represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control all of the intellectual property rights and other rights to your user materials as described in these Terms of Use, including all the rights necessary for you to post or submit your user materials.

In addition, by posting or otherwise submitting your user materials that contain images, photographs, pictures, videos, webcasts or that are otherwise graphical in whole or in part (“Images”), you represent and warrant that: (a) you own the copyright in such Images, or that you have obtained all necessary license(s) from the copyright owner(s) of such Images to use such Images, or portions thereof, in keeping with your use in connection with Roll20 and as otherwise permitted by these Terms of Use; (b) you have the rights necessary to grant the licenses and sublicenses described in these Terms of Use; and (c) you have received consent from any and all persons depicted in such Images to use the Images as set forth in these Terms of Use, including the distribution, public display, public performance and reproduction of such Images.

You are solely and entirely responsible for all of your user materials that you post or otherwise submit via Roll20. You shall assume all risks associated with the use of your user materials including any reliance on the accuracy, completeness or usefulness of your user materials. Tailor Made does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of your user materials. You acknowledge and agree that by accessing or using Roll20, you may be exposed to user materials from others that are offensive, indecent or otherwise objectionable.

##Who owns the IP of the images and sounds that I include in my campaigns via the Art Library, Marketplace, and Jukebox tools?

The tokens, map tiles, sounds, and other art assets that you include in your supports via the Art Library, Marketplace, and Jukebox tools are the intellectual property of the providers of the assets. For more information on the assets included in Roll20, and their providers, see the [Acknowledgements](/policies/acknowledgements.html) page and/or the individual asset page on the Marketplace. We have licensed these assets to allow you to use them to create non-commercial works in a personal setting. If you wish to re-distribute any campaigns you create on Roll20 that include assets from any of these providers outside of this intended purpose or outside of the Roll20 service, you must contact the provider(s) to license them directly. Tailor Made is not responsible for your use of the assets in any way that violates the rights of the providers. In addition, assets included from the Roll20 Marketplace are subject to the additional terms in the <a href="http://help.roll20.net/marketplace-eula/">Marketplace End User Licese Agreement (EULA)</a>.

Art that you include in your support via the web search and SoundCloud features come from a variety of websites across the Internet. We do our best to only include assets that can be used by you for non-commercial works in a personal setting, but the licensing of each asset may vary. We provide a credit, including a clickable link, above each art asset so that you can see where it is from and under what license it is released. You are solely responsible for any infringement of the rights of others that may occur by using these assets in your materials on Roll20.

#Reliability

##Do you guarantee that Roll20 will be accessible at all times?

In short, we do not. Like all other cloud-based applications, we are vulnerable to the inherent unreliability of the Internet.

We monitor Roll20 closely and have set up automated alarms to be notified (via email and SMS) when the Roll20 service is under stress, so that we can deal with the issue before it becomes a problem that might impact customer access.

You can see for yourself how we’re doing on this front over the last 30 days by looking at this Pingdom-powered chart:

<img src="http://share.pingdom.com/banners/07145829"  alt="Uptime for Roll20: Last 30 days " title=" Uptime for Roll20: Last 30 days" width="300" height="165" />

You acknowledge and agree that Tailor Made shall not be liable for any failure to store or retrieve your materials on Roll20 at any time.

You agree that you will not hold Tailor Made responsible or liable with respect to the third-party services.

##Special Treatment for Spammers

In the event of your or others’ access to or use of the Roll20 service in connection with the transmission of spam unsolicited e-mail or postings in violation of these Terms of Use, you acknowledge and agree that Tailor Made would be irreparably harmed thereunder and that monetary damages would be an insufficient and ineffective remedy; therefore you agree that Tailor Made is entitled to obtain immediate injunctive relief against any such transmission (in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity). Tailor Made may without restriction block, filter or delete unsolicited e-mail.

##Restriction and Termination of Use

Tailor Made may block, restrict, disable, suspend or terminate your access to all or part of Roll20 at any time in Tailor Made’s sole discretion, without prior notice or liability to you.

##Notification of Copyright Infringement (DMCA Policy)

Tailor Made will, in appropriate circumstances, terminate the accounts of users who infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Tailor Made will investigate notices of copyright infringement and take appropriate actions under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Title 17, United States Code, Section 512(c)(2) (“DMCA”).

If you believe that your work has been used or copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement and such infringement is occurring on Roll20 or on sites linked to from Roll20, please provide written notification of claimed copyright infringement to the designated agent for Roll20 (identified below), which must contain the following elements:

* A physical or electronic signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest that is alleged to have been infringed;
* A description of the copyrighted work or works that you claim have been infringed and identification of what content in such work(s) is claimed to be infringing and which you request to be removed or access to which is to be disabled;
* A description of where the content that you claim is infringing is located on Roll20;
* Information sufficient to permit Tailor Made to contact you, such as your physical address, telephone number, and e-mail address;
* A statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the use of the content identified in your Notice in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;
* A statement by you that the information in your notice is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf.

##Links to Third Party Sites

Roll20 may include links that will take you to other sites outside of the Roll20 service. The linked sites are provided by Tailor Made to you as a convenience and the inclusion of the links do not imply any endorsement by Tailor Made of any linked site. Tailor Made has no control of the linked sites and you therefore acknowledge and agree that Tailor Made is not responsible for the contents of any linked site, any link contained in a linked site or any changes or updates to a linked site. You further acknowledge and agree that Tailor Made is not responsible for any form of transmission (e.g. webcasting) received from any linked site.

##Advertisements and Promotions

Tailor Made may run advertisements and promotions from third parties via Roll20 in any manner or mode and to any extent. Your communications, activities, relationships and business dealings with any third parties advertising or promoting via Roll20, including payment and delivery of related goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, shall be solely matters between you and such third parties. You acknowledge and agree that Tailor Made is not responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as the result of any such dealings or as the result of the presence of such non-Tailor Made advertisers on Roll20.

##Warranties and Disclaimers

The Roll20 service and Tailor Made materials are provided by Tailor Made under these terms of use “as is” without warranty of any kind, either express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of title, non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. Without limiting the foregoing, Tailor Made makes no warranty that

Tailor Made may make changes to the site, materials and services, including the prices and descriptions of any software or products listed, at any time in its sole discretion and without notice. The Roll20 service and Tailor Made materials may be out of date, and Tailor Made makes no commitment to update the site, materials and services.

Managers, hosts, and other third parties are not authorized Tailor Made spokespersons, and their views do not necessarily reflect those of Tailor Made. To the maximum extent permitted by law, Tailor Made will have no liability related to user materials arising under intellectual property rights, libel, privacy, publicity, obscenity or other laws. Tailor Made also disclaims all liability with respect to the misuse, loss, modification or unavailability of any user materials.

The use of Roll20 service, Tailor Made materials or the downloading or other use of any materials is done at your own discretion and risk and with your agreement that you will be solely responsible for any damage to your computer system, loss of data or other harm that results from such activities. Tailor Made assumes no liability for any computer virus or other similar software code that is downloaded to your computer from the site or in connection with any services or materials. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from Tailor Made or via the site, services or materials shall create any warranty not expressly stated in the terms of use. Tailor Made will not be liable for any loss that you may incur as a result of someone else using your password or account with respect to the site or any services or materials, either with or without your knowledge.

Some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitations on how long an implied warranty may last, so the above limitations may not apply to you. To the extent permissible, any implied warranties are limited to ninety (90) days.

##Indemnity and Liability

You agree to indemnify and hold Tailor Made and its officers, co-branders, other partners and employees harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of:

#Governing Law and Jurisdiction

The Roll20 service (excluding linked sites) is controlled by Tailor Made Solutions, LLC from its offices within the state of Kansas, United States of America. By accessing Roll20, you agree that all matters relating to your access to, or use of, Roll20 shall be governed by the statutes and laws of the State of Kansas, without regard to the conflicts of laws principles thereof. The parties specifically disclaim the U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. You also agree and hereby submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of the Superior Court of Sedgwick County and the United States District Court for the 25th Judicial District of Kansas with respect to such matters.

#General

The Terms of Use and other rules, guidelines, licenses and disclaimers posted via Roll20 or in connection with the Materials and Services constitute the entire agreement between Tailor Made and you with respect to your access to or use of the Roll20 service and materials superseding any prior agreements between you and Tailor Made on such subject matter (including any prior versions of the Terms of Use). Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that any terms set forth in the Terms of Use expressly contradict any terms of a written agreement between you and Tailor Made regarding the use of specific Services or Materials (including Service-specific terms of use and Software-specific licenses) (“Executed Agreement”), such contradictory terms set forth in the Executed Agreement shall govern. You may also be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use other Tailor Made services, third party content or third party software. You may not assign or otherwise transfer the Terms of Use nor any right granted hereunder without Tailor Made’s prior written consent. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of the Terms of Use, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the intent of the parties as reflected by that provision, and the remainder of the Terms of Use shall continue in full force and effect. Any failure by Tailor Made to enforce or exercise any provision of the Terms of Use or related right shall not constitute a waiver of that right or provision. The section titles used in the Terms of Use are purely for convenience and carry with them no legal or contractual effect.
